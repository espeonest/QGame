.NET sliding puzzle
<hr>
With simple 2D boxes and doors, this sliding puzzle allows users to create their own levels, save them as .qgame files, and then open those files to play.

The objective is simple: Push the red boxes through the red doors and the green boxes through the green doors. Once all the boxes are cleared, the level is complete!

A very rudimentary sliding puzzle game, made for a class assignment.
